I am happy to join  with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. this momentous decree came as a great **beacon** light of **hope** to millions of Negro **slaves** who had been **seared** in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a **joyous** daybreak to end the long night of captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still **sadly** **crippled** by the manacles of segregation and the **chains** of  discrimination. One hundred year later, the Negro live on lonely island of poverty in the **midst** of avast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
