I am happy to join  with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. this momentous decree came as a great **beacon** light of **hope** to millions of Negro **slaves** who had been **seared** in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a **joyous** daybreak to end the long night of captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still **sadly** **crippled** by the manacles of segregation and the **chains** of  discrimination. One hundred year later, the Negro live on lonely island of poverty in the **midst** of avast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. 
In a sense, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When tha architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall her, This note was a promise that all men, yes, back men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
It is obvius today that America has defauled on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, American has given the Negro a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to belive that there are insufficient funds  in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we're come to cash this check, a check that will  give us upon demand thr riches of freedom and the security of justice.
